A module for creating epub files (although designed so that it may deal with)
other formats in the future.

    epub.Epub :: A class for creating OCF-compliant epub files.
    epub.container.Container :: A simple encapsulation of an epub container.xml
        file, capable of parsing and generating said file format.
    epub.toc.TableOfContents :: A class for encapsulating toc data, capable of
        parsing or generating NCX files.
    epub.publication.Publication :: Encapsulates the manifest and reading-order
        of a single publication, and can parse and generate OPF files.
